# Email_Chat_Webapp

I am thrilled to introduce you to a Email_Chat_webapp , a website app designed for online communication.
The app consists of a client folder, where in React has been installed through and a source file which includes the javascript file, Auth.js which is an authentication page file.
To open the login/ signup page :
In the command propt, run the command: 
cd client
and then run the below command,
npn run start
This will open the authentication page. 
For backend part, there is a server folder(JS file) 
To connect the database with mongodB, run the below command:
nodemon server.js
This will connect backend with the frontend part.
I have made the interface for the email chat(frontend part).A popup (compose box) will arise while clicking over new message
